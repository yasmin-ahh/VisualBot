# VisualBot
A Smart Indoor Robot Guide for Visually Impaired People

Through expanding functionalities of existing indoor navigating robots, we aim to aid visually impaired
individuals in guiding them through closed environments using an autonomously operated robotic
guide. In our design, we used a Turtlebot3 robot, an NVIDIA GPU for processing, Raspberry Pi, OpenCR
board, Camera and LDS sensor. A map of the engineering building floor was created and used for
navigation and obstacle avoidance. Voice recognition tools are used to take commands from the user
and navigate the user to the desired location in the engineering building. The robot can detect doors,
people and chairs and assist the user with voice instructions using a Bluetooth speaker.
